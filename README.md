## SIBI TRANSLATOR
It was hard to communicate between deaf or speech impaired and normal people because speech impaired can’t talk and deaf can’t listen well to other people so they use sign language. Normal people don’t understand sign language because they never learn it. So we want to make a project that can help us to translate sign language. There are two sign languages that are used in Indonesia, SIBI and BISINDO. We use SIBI for this project because SIBI is good for formal situations.
